## What is this ?

It is a small collection of summaries I am making for my classes this semester. For classes that do not have a lot of equation, I prefer using markdown compiled in pdf with pandoc. It is faster than simply using $\LaTeX$ on overleaf.

## Classes

### Ecodesign

Lot of schematics and text and not a lot of equations.

### IC

Some equations but no need to be ultra clean and I will use a lot of screenshots. Good basis for the open book exam

## Compilation

You can clone this repo and compile locally with the `make` command. You will need *pandoc* and the base version of *texlive* installed.

You can also simply grabbed the already compiled pdf that gets compiled each time someone push to the main branch.
